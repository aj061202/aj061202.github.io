    <td>After Mr Keen explained how and which parts of the editing we needed to use to change which bits, it was quite easy. It was easy once Mr Keen had explained because we just needed to find colours for background, font etc. and i'd  already had made a substantial change to my website. Listening to Mr Keen was the most important part because if not it would have been very hard to find where to go to change different parts. I also moved seats and sat basically by myself which helped as well.</td>

    <td>I took quite a long time to complete the first bit(getting background colours) because i was still unsure how to do it but after that it was fine. One habit i need to get rid off is trying to do everything perfect, next time i will do it and move on so i don't waste time.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time i will do the work quicker and more efficiently rather than trying to do everything perfectly and i will also try and start my blog in the lesson as well to save time at home. I did well this week but i could also experiment with more advanced things like gifs as my backgrounds or profile picture.</td>
